ATM project isn't developed, but it doesn't mean that it's the end of it or that it won't be updated in the future. For now I just have other things to do.

SocialGraph is written in C++ for mIRC. It is based on [Java PieSpy](http://www.jibble.org/piespy/)
it generates images which shows who is talking with who in specific IRC channel like this one:

Latest compiled revision [R59](https://code.google.com/p/socialgraphdll/source/detail?r=59) should contain all latest features.. But In [R58](https://code.google.com/p/socialgraphdll/source/detail?r=58) there has been a BIG commit, so it might still have some unfixed nasty errors left.

For now I'm primarily focused in adding new features to SocialGraphDll and so on, so all new config variables are sitting unexplained and wont be explained for a while (probably), and few features might be buggy or not working as expected.
Anyway, I tried to make #sample.config.txt to be as good as possible for general use, so all those advanced variables should be left untouched, unless you know what they do :).

Basic install instructions are old and contains many grammar errors (because when i wrote them, I was young and stupid), however, it should be enough for basic SocialGraphDll setup.  http://code.google.com/p/socialgraphdll/source/browse/trunk/SocialGraphDll/mIRC/SocialGraph/Installation.txt

At the moment i don't have time to translate all comments in config file to English and to write full English documentation. Sorry.

Here is a latest video generated using experimental video rendering feature: <a href='http://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_embedded&v=eJVC4-N6ABc' target='_blank'><img src='http://img.youtube.com/vi/eJVC4-N6ABc/0.jpg' width='425' height=344 /></a>

Still, got any questions? Write email to me or in the bug tracker x]
